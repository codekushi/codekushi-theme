## This is GitHub Pages Theme for my GitHub repos inspired from [Jason long cayman theme](https://github.com/jasonlong/cayman-theme)

GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. You can see examples of GitHub Pages sites in the GitHub Pages examples collection.Unless you're using a custom domain, user and organization sites are available at http(s)://username.github.io
